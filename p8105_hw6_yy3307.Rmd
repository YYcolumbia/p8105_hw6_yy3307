## Problem 1


## Problem 2

First we need to import and clean the `homicide` dataset. Then I'm going to `mutate` a `city_state` variable to combine `city` and `state`, with a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. The next step is to `filter` out multiple `city_state` which are not valid under our condition.

```{r}
homicide_raw = 
  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>% 
  filter(
    city_state != "Dallas, TX", 
    city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", 
    city_state != "Kansas City, MO", 
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL"
  )
```
